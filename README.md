Inspired by recent condensed matter physics studies (such as [Ref.1](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys4035), [Ref.2](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys4037), and [Ref.3](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.195105)) on classifying phases of matter using machine learning methods, this tutorial provides a brief introduction on the Ising model, how the spin configurations in the Ising model are sampled by Monte Carlo simulation, and using trained neural network to discriminate the low- and the high-temperature phases from the raw spin configurations sampled with Monte Carlo.
