Inspired by recent condensed matter physics studies (such as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)) on classifying phases of matter using machine learning methods, this tutorial provides a brief introduction on the Ising model, how the spin configurations in the Ising model are sampled by Monte Carlo simulation, and using trained neural network to discriminate the low- and the high-temperature phases from the raw spin configurations sampled with Monte Carlo.
